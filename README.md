# Backend for Automated Time Series Forecasting
This is the simpliflied version of the backend from my capstone project "Automated Time Series Forecasting: Using Hybrid Forecasting Approach".

The project was initially developed using the PHP's Laravel framework. Blade template is served using the PHP Laravel server. And a dedicated flask applicaiton was developed using Python's Flask framework. 

I am rewriting the simplified version (the key feature of my project) by separating the backend and frontend. For the frontend i am using the React JS and for the backend i am using the Flask for its lightweight and fast development.
